# Wheelchair-Code
Wheelchair code
This project is for a concept electronic wheelchair. 
It is meant for those paralysed that still have function in the neck. 
The wheelchair is able to turn left and right and go straight.
There is an attachment that would go on the head of the user (on a helmet) which would allow the user to control the wheelchair. 
It turns with the tilt of the head towards the direction desired to turn to.
It goes straight when the head is tilted foward.
